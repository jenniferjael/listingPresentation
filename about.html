        <h2>Behind Negotiations</h2>
        <p>
          I came to the United States about 17 years ago. Starting and adapting
          to a new country was not easy. The death of my father shortly after
          arriving changed my life and many of my goals had to be put on standby
          in order to help my mother with my two brothers. Although these
          circumstances were not the best, I am grateful that despite the
          difficulties, both I and my family were able to move forward and
          resume our path without forgetting the principles that our father
          instilled in us and the determination to go behind our dreams.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I dedicated myself for a long time to the medical field but I always
          felt my passion for Real Estate. My parents were always independent
          contractors and I always had in mind to do the same. I have always
          liked reading about real estate investments and helping my family in
          the sale and purchase of real estate. When the pandemic affected my
          work, I felt that my opportunity to go after my dream had arrived and
          in March 2020 I began to swim in this very rewarding career.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          For me, real estate is the path to many of my dreams including the
          dreams that my father could not fulfill. Thanks to this beautiful
          career, my husband and I have started our business in Ecuador. 123
          hectares dedicated to the production of Abaca and other forest trees.
          This is not only our great project but also the way to create a source
          of work in this region that needs it so much, being one of the ways to
          share the many blessings received.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          During these two years I have learned so much not only from my coach
          but the different extraordinary people that are part of Keller
          Williams. I feel fortunate to belong to a company that truly cares
          about each one of us and our clients. I prepare myself every day so as
          not to disappoint the trust that my clients put in me and to offer the
          best experience during a real estate transaction.
